Things that need done before releasing completed--mostly correct--work for section 1.3.1:

1.	Fix logical errors in e21-28.scm's mrprime? (Ex. 1.28)
		- implement looped testing for mrprime? (see fast-prime?)
2.	Pretty up some code (find specific examples of ugliness to fix here)
		- all over e21-28.scm
		- 1.3.1 is surprisingly neat
