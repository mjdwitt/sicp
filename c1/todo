Things that need done before releasing completed--mostly correct--work for section 1.3.1:

1.	Fix logical errors in e21-28.scm's mrprime? (Ex. 1.28)
		- after some testing of prime? and mrprime? side-by-side, 
 			it seems that mrprime? is failing inconsistantly.
			Here I was under the impression that it was supposed
			to be consistent.
2.	Pretty up some code (find specific examples of ugliness to fix here)
