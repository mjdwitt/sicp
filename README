This is a collection of solutions to the exercises in Abelson, Sussman, and 
Sussman's _Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_.  Each file 
is named according to the exercise for which it is a solution and all follow
the naming scheme of ex-x.scm where e is for exercise and x-x is the number 
of the exercise (i.e.: e1-1 means Exercise 1.1). If an exercise uses multiple
files, the files will be in a folder following the same scheme.

Any questions can be directed to Michael DeWitt: md@hackfoolery.com.
