This is a collection of solutions to the exercises in Abelson, Sussman, and 
Sussman's _Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_.  Each file 
is named according to the exercise for which it is a solution and all follow
the naming scheme of cX/eY where c is for chapter, e is for exercise, and X 
and Y are the chapter numbers, respectively.  (i.e.: c1/e1 is Exercise 1.1.)
If an exercise uses multiple files, the files will be in a folder following 
the same scheme.
